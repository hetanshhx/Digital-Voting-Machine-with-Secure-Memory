# Digital Voting Machine with Secure Memory

A comprehensive simulation of a secure digital voting machine built using an Arduino UNO in the Proteus Design Suite. This project fulfills all the core requirements of designing a basic electronic voting system, demonstrating key embedded systems concepts.

## Features & Guidelines Implemented

This project successfully implements the following guidelines:

* **State Machine for Vote Counting Logic:** The machine's operation is controlled by a robust state machine with distinct states (`VOTING_MODE`, `RESULTS_MODE`, `MESSAGE_MODE`). This ensures the program flows logically and prevents invalid operations, such as casting a vote while viewing results.

* **Secure Data Storage using EEPROM:** Vote counts are stored in non-volatile EEPROM. This secures the data against power loss, meaning the results are preserved even if the machine is turned off and on again.

* **Display Results on LCD:** A 16x2 LCD screen provides a clear user interface for real-time feedback, displaying welcome messages, vote confirmations, and final tabulated results.

* **Debouncing Logic for Tactile Switches:** All button inputs are debounced using a software timer (`millis()`). This prevents a single physical button press from being incorrectly registered as multiple votes, ensuring accurate counting.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    ```
2.  **Open the Simulation:**
    * Navigate to the project folder and open the Proteus project file (`.pdsprj`).

3.  **Compile the Firmware:**
    * Open the Arduino source code (`.ino` file) in the Arduino IDE.
    * Go to **Sketch > Export Compiled Binary**. This will create a `.hex` file in the same folder.

4.  **Load the Firmware into Proteus:**
    * In the Proteus schematic, double-click the Arduino UNO model.
    * In the "Program File" field, click the folder icon and select the `.hex` file you just created.
    * Ensure the "Processor Clock Frequency" is set to **16MHz**.

5.  **Run the Simulation:**
    * Click the "Play" button at the bottom of the Proteus window to start the simulation.

## Code Overview

The Arduino code is structured around the state machine. The main `loop()` function checks for debounced button presses and calls a central `handleButtonPress()` function. This function then determines the appropriate action based on the machine's current state, making the logic clean and easy to follow.
